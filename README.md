# LeadersCorner
 
This is my first project and it is meant for a final exam of  ASP.NET Core course at the Software University. 

My idea was to create a website for individuals with interest in leadership and management. Thus the site has some funcionality in order to register a user and an author of article. The project is designed to provide a place to share your ideas. A user could comment an article or could register as author and write some article. 

In addition, if you are an author, you could conduct some course. The website has different course aspect and an author could register a course and comment one.
