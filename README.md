# LeadersCorner
 
This is my first project and it is meant for a final exams of  ASP.NET Core course at the Software University. 

My idea was to create a website for individuals with interest in leadership and management. Thus the site has some funcionality in order to register as a user and as author of article to share your ideas. A user could comment an article or could register as author and write some article. 

In addition, if you an author you could provide some course. the ebsite has different course aspect and al the author could register a course.
